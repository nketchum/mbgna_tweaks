Upgrading from D9 to D10

1. Update modules:
	- $ composer update

SKIP THIS SECOND STEP
This would be ideal but trips up composer due to D10 version constraints. Instead,
we will simply uninstall the two related calendar modules and figure something out later.
2. Patch modules: 
	- drupal/calendar: 3356537-8 

3. Delete rogue modules not installed and not in composer.json:
	- $ rm -rf web/modules/contrib/layout_builder_admin_theme
	- $ rm -rf web/modules/contrib/layoutcomponents
	- $ rm -rf web/modules/contrib/media_library_form_element
	- $ rm -rf web/modules/contrib/viewsreference

4. Uninstall the awful calendar module and views_templates
	- $ drush pm:uninstall calendar
	- $ drush pm:uninstall views_templates

5. Remove the awful calendar_datetime module (manually through the UI)
	- Manual uninstallation through UI: /admin/modules/uninstall
	- $ composer remove drupal/calendar_datetime

6. Remove the awful calendar module
	- $ composer remove drupal/calendar
	- $ composer remove drupal/views_templates

7. Clear cache
	- $ drush cr

8. Update core dependencies without running update:
	- $ composer require 'drupal/core-recommended:^10' 'drupal/core-composer-scaffold:^10' 'drupal/core-project-message:^10' --update-with-dependencies --no-update

9. We usually have core-dev installed too, so similar command:
	- $ composer require 'drupal/core-dev:^10' --dev --update-with-dependencies --no-update

10. Create a .env file in the project root
	- $ cp env.example .env

11. Run composer update
	- $ composer update -W

12. Remove patches from composer.json
	- drupal/calendar
	- drupal/tb_megamenu
	- delete /patches in the project root

13. Fix an error with tb_megamenu via drush updb
	- $ drush updb -> "PHP Fatal error:  Cannot use Drupal\Component\Utility\Xss as Xss because the name is already in use in /app/web/modules/contrib/tb_megamenu/src/Entity/MegaMenuConfig.php on line 11"
	- Delete "use Drupal\Component\Utility\Xss;" from line 11 in MegaMenuConfig.php

14. Update db
	- $ drush updb

15. Clear cache
	- $ drush cr
